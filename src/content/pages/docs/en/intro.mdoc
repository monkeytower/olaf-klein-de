# 📘 Project Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the **Olaf Klein** website project. This guide details how we migrated from a legacy system to a modern, high-performance **Jamstack** architecture.

## 🎯 Goal
To create a fast, secure, and easily manageable website using best-in-class open source technologies.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

We selected this stack for its performance, developer experience, and cost-efficiency (free tier friendly):

-   **[Astro](https://astro.build)**: The web framework. Optimized for static content and speed.
-   **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
-   **[Keystatic](https://keystatic.com)**: A Git-based Content Management System (CMS). No database required.
-   **[Coolify](https://coolify.io)**: Self-hosted PaaS platform (deploy apps like magic).
-   **Docker**: For containerized deployment on any Linux server.
-   **[Google Gmail API](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api)**: For sending emails securely via OAuth2 / backend.
-   **[Cloudflare Turnstile](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/turnstile/)**: Privacy-focused CAPTCHA alternative to block spam.

## 🐒 The Magic: Vibe Coding & Automation

The most unique aspect of this project is that it was **100% created with AI support**. From the initial server setup of the **DALM Factory** to the complex Gmail API integration and the final styling refinements, not a single line of code was touched manually by Olaf. 

Everything was **"Vibe-Coded"** and **"Vibe-Installed"** using AI-driven agents and automated Ansible playbooks. We have moved from being "Digital Janitors" to sovereign architects.

### 🚀 The DALM Factory (Deploy Apps Like Magic)
We are building a permanent, sovereign home for the Vibe Coding era. No more WordPress plugin hell—just raw power. The infrastructure (managed via Ansible/Coolify) consists of our own "H2G2 Fleet":

*   🏗️ **MAGRATHEA (The Factory)**: Our private Vercel. Runs Coolify for Git-to-Live deploys and n8n for our automation brain.
*   🛡️ **MARVIN (The Guard)**: Paranoid security & monitoring. Runs Borg backups and Uptime Kuma.
*   🕹️ **EDDIE (The Cockpit)**: Emergency "break glass" station. Browser-based VS Code via Cloudflare Tunnel.
*   🍽️ **MILLIWAYS (The Cash Cow)**: Isolated legacy hosting. They pay for the party; we enjoy the metal.

**Don’t Panic. The future is static.** 🌌🐒
