Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the **Olaf Klein** website project. This guide details how we migrated from a legacy system to a modern, high-performance **Jamstack** architecture.

## 🎯 Goal
To create a fast, secure, and easily manageable website using best-in-class open source technologies.
